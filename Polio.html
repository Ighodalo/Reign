		<h3>Who We Are</h3>
		AFRICA HAS reported some genuinely good news in the battle to eradicate polio. Late last month , Nigeria passed a full year without a case of wild poliovirus. As of Aug. 11, it has been a year since the last case was detected anywhere on the continent (it was in Somalia). These anniversaries are unofficial milestones, but they point toward continued progress against polio, a scourge that once claimed hundreds of thousands of lives each year. Unfortunately, polio has shown a fierce tendency to return. Hopefully this time will be different.

Nigeria’s accomplishment is impressive. The country suffered a major setback in the struggle against the disease more than a decade ago when a state governor and religious leaders in the predominantly Islamic north put into effect a year-long vaccination ban, claiming that the vaccines were contaminated by the West to spread sterility and HIV/AIDS among Muslims. This led to a wider outbreak of the virus, which is highly contagious, largely strikes children under 5 years old and can cause permanent paralysis. Another effort by Nigeria to come to grips with polio in 2009 seemed to falter when the militant group Boko Haram carried out a wave of violent attacks in the north that disrupted vaccination. The oral vaccine is effective if it can be given to enough children to prevent and interrupt transmission. As recently as 2012, Nigeria had 122 cases — and it now is down to zero.

A valuable lesson from Nigeria is that containing polio requires a multifaceted campaign that goes beyond dispensing vaccines. One important tactic was to address head-on the rumors and myths about the vaccine that undermined earlier campaigns. Local volunteers were brought in to build trust. Health teams used “hit and run” tactics to enter a dangerous area quickly, vaccinate and then exit. Yet another approach was to offer “health camps” that provided a wide array of everyday medical treatments, not just for polio, which gave parents an incentive to bring their children for vaccination. Nigeria also benefited from the determined focus of organizations such as Rotary International, which invested $207 million to fight polio in the country, as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, UNICEF, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and others.

<h3>Polio Today</h3>

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation plans to pay off the $76 million debt that Nigeria owes Japan for resources used to eradicate polio.

It marks yet another investment by the Gates Foundation in the fight against the ancient disease. In 2017, the Gates Foundation reported it had so far spent a total of $3 billion on anti-polio efforts.

“You might be wondering why we're spending so much money when there's only 12 cases,” said Jay Wenger, a medical doctor who leads the Gates Foundation's polio eradication effort, to CNBC. “We want to be sure we finish it off.”

In the foundation’s 2017 annual letter, Bill Gates was optimistic that the end of polio was near, adding:

“...ending polio will save lives—through the magic of zero. When polio is eradicated, the world can dedicate polio funds to improving child health, and the lessons from polio will lead to better immunization systems for other diseases.”



According to Quartz Africa, the Gates Foundation had agreed in 2014 to pay off Nigeria’s debt over a 20-year period if the country could achieve “more than 80% vaccination coverage in at least one round each year in very high risk areas across 80% of the country’s local government areas.”

The efforts seem to have paid off. Nigeria, which accounted for more than half of all polio cases in 2012, reported zero new cases of the infectious disease in 2017. But achieving widespread immunization in the African nation has been difficult.

One major factor that has contributed to the lingering of polio in Nigeria has been cultural opposition to immunization. This sentiment can, in part, be traced back to 2003 when a physician on a Nigerian government committee said Western medicine was “corrupted and tainted by evildoers from America and their Western allies.”

Not long after announcing a $100 million donation to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease, Bill and Melinda Gates have agreed to pay off Japan's $76 million loan to Nigeria to stamp out polio, Quartz reports.

Polio has been eradicated in most countries around the world, but it's still present in Nigeria, as well as in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 2008, according to The Conversation, Nigeria accounted for 86 percent of all polio cases in Africa. This high number was thanks in part to low immunization rates and calls from extremists to boycott polio vaccinations out of fear that they were tainted with anti-fertility steroids.<br/>
National and international campaigns were launched to lower polio rates in Nigeria, and in 2014 the nation received the loan from Japan to boost disease-fighting efforts. Progress has been made since then, with no new cases of polio reported in Nigeria in 2017. Two children had contracted polio in 2016, two years after Nigeria's last known case.

Nigeria's loan repayments to Japan were slated to begin in 2018. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation agreed to cover the costs after Nigeria met its goal of "achieving more than 80 percent vaccination coverage in at least one round each year in very high risk areas across 80 percent of the country's local government areas," Quartz reports. The loan will be repaid over the next 20 years.

While the Gates Foundation is lending a hand to Nigeria, the Associated Press reports that health officials in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province recently launched a new chapter in the nation's ongoing struggle against the disease. Health workers will engage in a week-long, door-to-door vaccination campaign, though efforts like this are risky due to threats from the Taliban and other militant groups, who view vaccinations as a Western conspiracy and believe they sterilize children. Anti-polio efforts in Pakistan also suffered after the CIA used vaccinations as a cover to get DNA samples from the Bin Laden compound.

<h3>Financing</h3>

By Quentin Wodon, president, Rotary Club of Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C., USA<br/>

As a lead economist at the World Bank, it has been exciting to see my organization step up to the plate and commit resources to the fight to eradicate polio, as we observe World Polio Day.

While the World Bank is not one of the spearheading partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), the organization does work closely with the GPEI, of which Rotary is a leading partner, as well as country governments to provide financing to help end polio. At the request of the Government of Nigeria, the World Bank has recently committed $125 million for polio eradication in the country this summer. About half of these resources will fund oral polio vaccines and other operational requirements, while the other half will help fund routine immunizations.

In considering the World Bank’s investments, I am struck by how intertwined the two issues of polio eradication and broader development are.

The World Bank program document notes multiple obstacles to eradicating polio, in large part due to the lack of security in the northeast caused by the Boko Haram insurgency. As a result, special measures are being introduced including “hit and run” interventions to immunize children and get out as quickly as possible in problem areas; building a “firewall” by ensuring immunity in areas surrounding these inaccessible villages; relying on local volunteers who won’t draw attention as vaccinators; reintroducing the Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) into routine immunizations; conducting bus stop and market vaccinations; and ensuring that all people in the displacement camps have been vaccinated.

Take part in World Polio Day

In addition, the World Bank is providing another $450 million to support development projects in Nigeria’s northeast including:

immediate basic social infrastructure and psychosocial support to communities most affected by displacement;
labor-intensive work and skills development for youth, women and the unemployed as well as cash transfers for displaced families and individuals who return voluntarily and safely to their old communities;
access to irrigation and drainage services, delivery of agricultural inputs, and other support for farmers in conflict-affected households, particularly women and youth;
financial incentives for teachers who have completed psycho-social training as well as grants to schools to address specific needs identified by school-based management committees;
health services with a focus on maternal, newborn and child health, nutrition, psycho-social support and mental health, as well as mobile clinics in communities in which health facilities have been destroyed.
I have written about some of the World Bank’s past efforts toward eradicating polio in the Rotarian Economist blog, including  an innovative buy-down mechanism through which the World Bank partnered with Rotary, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Center for Disease Control and the United Nations Foundation to finance polio eradication in Nigeria. Other posts have talked about World Bank investments with polio components in Pakistan, Yemen, and Nigeria.

The needs in Nigeria’s northeast are enormous. Let’s hope that the financing provided by the World Bank and other development partners will help eradicate polio, support development, and make a major difference in the life of those affected by the conflict.
Since the GPEI’s launch in 1988, over US$ 15 billion has been invested through WHO and UNICEF in support of polio eradication activities carried out in over 70 countries. These contributions have helped reduce the incidence of polio by 99% and have laid the foundation for an infrastructure to be used beyond polio eradication.

Financial contributions provided through WHO and UNICEF are supplemented by in-kind contributions within countries such as the time spent by volunteers, health workers and others in the planning and implementation of supplementary immunization activities. These contributions are estimated to have a dollar value approximately equal to that of international financial contributions.
The Financial Resource Requirements (FRR) provides an overview of the budget for activities planned by the GPEI for the 2013-2019 period to eradicate all remaining polio disease and prepare for the post-eradication era in keeping with the Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2019 and its four objectives.  The budget that underpins the FRR is prepared jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the national governments.

The GPEI budget for 2017 is currently estimated at US$ 1.119 billion and is available as an interactive budget tool. For a description of each objective and budget category, please see the April 2016 Financial Resource Requirements.

For the period beyond 2017, the GPEI is developing epidemiological scenarios, which will be costed and form the basis of the budget until certification. The overall GPEI budget for the 2013-2019 period remains US$ 7.0 billion.

In addition to the FRRs, the GPEI also provides updated information on available resources from public and private sector donors against the FRRs. Currently, the GPEI needs to secure US$ 1.5 billion. <br/>

On July 24th Nigeria celebrated a huge milestone in the global effort to eradicate polio. It has been one year since the country has had a case of wild polio. This means that it has interrupted transmission of the crippling disease.

Before the advent of polio eradication efforts, Nigeria suffered from many thousands of paralytic polio cases every year. Many of the crippled victims of the disease can still be seen, a stark testimony to the human costs of this preventable disease.

Now that Nigeria has interrupted transmission, it is two years away from being certified as having eradicated the disease. This will be a global public good of the first order! Now only two other countries-Afghanistan and Pakistan-have widely circulating wild polio virus and the world is on the cusp of polio eradication.

Besides the obvious benefit of preventing polio, the polio eradication effort in Nigeria has provided other benefits. The lessons learned from polio and the infrastructure developed were instrumental in successfully containing the Ebola epidemic that broke out in 2014. Polio has also provided the backbone for strengthening disease surveillance and public health throughout Nigeria.

Nigeria has authorised Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to start the repayment of $76 million polio eradication facility to Japan.

The Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun, made this known in Abuja on Tuesday when she received a delegation of Japanese House of Councillors Parliamentarians.

She said that the delegates were in Nigeria to assess the level of usage of Overseas Development Assistance (ODAs) extended to Nigeria since 2014.

She added that the authority to trigger repayment was given to Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation following the eradication of polio in the country.

She noted that the eradication of polio was made possible as a result of the ODA facility provided by the Japanese Government valued at 76 million dollars in 2014.

She recalled that the ODA was structured for repayment after four years and that by this development, Bill and Mellinda Gates Foundation would start repaying the facility to Japan this year.

Mrs. Adeosun while marketing Nigeria to the Japanese delegation noted that Nigeria was fast growing and evolving from negative areas to positive areas through its determined fight against corruption.

She added that “because Nigeria is a middle income country, we will require the expertise of Japanese companies for infrastructure development.

“Nigeria is a good place to invest because it is a rising investment destination.


 
“I promise that the government will make life easy for Japanese investors wishing to do business in Nigeria.”

In his address, the leader of the delegation, Kiyoshi Ejima, described Nigeria as a power house with rich natural resources with which Japan tried to strengthen relationship with.

Nigeria, he said, had set the target of becoming one of the top 20 economies by the year 2020 and he assured that “Japan will support Nigeria toward realising its 2020 target.”
